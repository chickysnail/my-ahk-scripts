I decided to modify my keyboard. I hope you find the scripts as useful as I
This repository will be updated from time to time as I explore what new features I might find handy 

# How to install
1. Download and install [AutoHotKey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe)
2. Clone my repository
3. Create a link to Startup.ahk in your startup folder (mine is C:\Users\Artem\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) to make the script run automatically on startup

# Features
1. `Win+n` opens notepad
2. You might need to remove this: `\` is bind to Enter because I have german keyboard with `enter` button split in two
3. `Capslock` functions as `Ctrl` everywhere (I hate capslock)
4. With `Win+b` you activate listener to do some handy things (not much yet)
